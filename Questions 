1. Name one thing you like about using GitHub and one about 
using Cpanel hosting.

I like github a lot because I felt as though getting the code uploaded through 
terminal was easy, whereas Cpanel was more user friendly with a easier 
to interact with. 


2. What was the most satisfying part of this assignment?

I loved being able to translate the coding html mess of code 
into a live website and having that be live on the internet.
